        <div class = "col"><h3>What is MyFitnessPal:</h3></div>
        <div class = "row"> - MyFitnessPal is a calorie and workout tracking app. This app has helped many people reach their fitness goals. They also have a review system with 3.7 Million 5 star reviews.</div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <div class ="row">
        <div class = "col"><h3>Most Effective Method:</h3></div>
        <div class = "row"> - Informational videos have been extremly effective in getting people motivated and informed on how to begin training. Many people stop working out after the first 2 weeks and this app helps to keep people accountable. There are countless reviews of users explaing how easier training became with using this app.</div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class = "col"><h3>Use Of Technology:</h3></div>
        <div class = "row"> - Currently there are meal prep plans and a database full of the macros for certain food. You can just search up anyfood and the app will provide you with the calories and protien ect. of that food. They could add a blog of sorts where people could chat with eachother and talk about how their fitness goals are going.</div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
        <div class = "row">
          <div class = "col"><h3>Implications:</h3></div>
          <div class = "row"> - On my website/app Im definitly going to include a calorie tracking and more informational videos about anything users might have questions about. I also want to include a blog because that could be very influential to users motivation and help with keeping eachother accountable. I think My app will be very close to what MyFitnessPal is with a few changes that that will also help users mental health. These could include the previously stated blog or even a video chat service where people can talk with eachother about their roblems.</div>
